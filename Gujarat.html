Being a science student in my school days, I was very excited about going to Gujarat Science City. I expected interactive exhibits with guides and an opportunity to understand science and have the first-hand experience of academic knowledge that I got in school.
            
            Instead, I encountered the rude staff who were unwilling to start the ride or show, citing low participant numbers, poor quality 3-D show and vaguely described science exhibits without any guide/expert.</h5>
