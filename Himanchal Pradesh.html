        <h2>Rohtang Pass</h2>
        <h5>At an elevation of 13,054 ft, Rohtang Pass serves as the gateway to Lahaul and Spiti valleys in Himachal Pradesh.

Besides Lahaul and Spiti, Rohtang Pass also serves as the gateway to Pangi and the valley of Leh. Like the Zojila Pass, Rohtang also serves as the gateway to Ladakh.


            The name Rohtang means ‘ground of corpses’ due to the number of people who lost their lives trying to cross it. The Rohtang Pass is on the Pir Panjal Mountain Range of the Himalayas. The Rohtang Pass is a natural divide between the humid Kullu Valley, which has predominantly Hindu culture and the arid, high altitude Lahaul and Spiti Valleys which mainly has Buddhists.
            
            Known for its scenic beauty, Rohtang Pass holds strategic importance for India. The Pass offers beautiful sights of glaciers, peaks, Lahaul Valley and the Chandra River. The twin peaks of Geypan are also visible from Rohtang.</h5>
