Statues of Shri Krishna and his admirers, portraying essential occasions surrounding the Lord's life, cover the main temple. Various scenes from Krishna's life, like raising the Govardhan Mountain, have been depicted on the periphery of the Prem Mandir. The lighting of the temple further glorifies its spectacular look, especially during the night. The colored water twists and twirls to the tunes of the kirtans of Radha Krishna being played nearby and are an audio-visual delight.
